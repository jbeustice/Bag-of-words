Data comes from http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/.
I compiled all the negative reviews into one folder, and all the positive reviews into another folder.
The bag_of_words.py reads in the data and builds 4 models using Naive Bayes and SVM
(and extracting features based om word occurence and TF-IDF algorithms).
